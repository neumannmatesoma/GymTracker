# Overview
## Description
A few years ago, I started working on a mobile application to track my gym progress, driven by personal motivation and a desire to improve my Android development skills. The project focuses on building a clean and user-friendly UI, which I designed and implemented using Android Fragments and XML layouts. While the user interface is mostly complete, the app's core functionality has not yet been developed due to time constraints. Despite its unfinished state, the project helped me gain hands-on experience with Android UI design and mobile app structure.
